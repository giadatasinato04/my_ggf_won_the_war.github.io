He was ordered to fight against boys like himself, who had done nothing to him. <br>He talked about the war as little as possible. He told us only a few bad memories. He said they were forced to go and fight at close steel. One against the other. Against a man they had never seen before, who had done nothing to them. And they had to kill him. He used to say:"It was him or me." <br>He died at the age of 97, and only in his last years did he begin to tell us some small memories of his time on the Banjšice Plateau and on Mount Grappa. While telling these things, you could see his face change because of the pain of those memories. He was a good and quiet person. He even had compassion for those poor donkeys which had to carry ammunitions for the cannons and soldiers up the "mule tracks". Imagine what a legacy those moments left him. <br> In 1978 he was awarded by our mayor on behalf of the Head of State as <em>Cavaliere di Vittorio Veneto</em>. But even on that occasion, in front of the war memorial, on his face, as on those of the other survivors, the only visible emotion was grief for their memories.» <br><br> - <em>Maria Rosa Belluco, my grandmother</em>.<br> </p>

    <p align="justify" >Italy entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">First World War</a> in the spring of 1915, after signing the secret <b>Treaty of London</b> with Great Britain, France, and Russia. On May 23rd, 1915 Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Cadorna">Luigi Cadorna</a> decided to concentrate his efforts across the Isonzo River valley, from the Adriatic Sea to the Julian Alps. </p>
<p align="justify"> Twelve were the Battles of the Isonzo. Most of them were inconclusive. The two armies, the Italian and the Austro-Hungarian, were <b>virtually equally powerful</b> and when one advanced a few kilometers, the other one would attack to regain territory after a couple of months. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Battle_of_the_Isonzo">The Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo</a> was fought in <b>August 1917</b>. The Italian army managed to conquer 10 kilometers of ground, reaching the Banjšice Plateau and Mount Santo. However, this battle was only a bloodbath, during which <b>50.000 soldiers died</b> and 153.000 were wounded. Nevertheless, something did change. The Second Army of the Italian troops was forced to split in two, on the two different sides of the Isonzo River, leaving a <b>weak point</b> that the enemies exploited in the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo.<p>
<p align="justify">Also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Caporetto">Battle of Caporetto</a>, it is considered the <b>greatest defeat in Italian history</b>. German troops had come to the aid of their allies and decided to change their attack strategy. Instead of bombarding the front lines of the Italian trenches for days, they only sent a few bombs and then <b>attacked the Italian army in depth</b>. Moreover, for the first time in this front, gasses were used by the Germans. The Italian troops were ordered to retreat. They lost 150 kilometers of Italian territory, as they managed to block the enemies only after crossing the Piave River, just before the Po Valley. After this battle, <b>everything changed on the Italian side</b>.

    <p align="justify">Cadorna, the Italian Chief of Staff, was fired. He had poorly planned the defense and attack strategy on the Isonzo River and was blamed for the outrageous defeat. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Diaz">Armando Diaz</a> became the new General of the Italian army.  It is curious to notice that the government named him not only because he had demonstrated <b>good strategic skills</b>, but also because he was not an important figure in Italian society. The most logical choice would have been to appoint as Chief of Staff the Duke of Aosta, whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Army_(Italy)">Third Army</a> had won every battle and conquered many territories. However, the Duke was the the King's cousin. He was too important and he could not afford to lose. Diaz, on the other hand, was almost a nobody. In case of defeat, he could have been easily blamed and removed.</p>
    <p align="justify">When the enemies entered Italian soil, they <b>occupied 150.000 square kilometers</b> covering the provinces of Udine, Belluno, Treviso, Venezia, and Vicenza. After Caporetto, many people were living under Austria-Hungarian rule. They had to follow new, strict norms, and curfews and passports were introduced to ensure law and order. By the people living in those lands, the last year of war is remembered as <em><b>l'an de la fam</b></em>, which in Veneto's dialect means "the year of hunger". The situation was so bad, that mices were essicated and eaten. The <b>new propaganda strategy</b> focused on the suffering of the Italian people living in the occupied territories to enlive the spirits of the soldiers and try to prepare them for the coming battles. Anyways, from November 1917 to June 1918 both sides stood firm. A few minor attacks were planned and a few bombs were launched, but for <b>seven long months</b> nothing significant happened on the Alpine front.</p>
    <p align="justify">On June 15th, 1918, the Austro-Hungarian army begun the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Piave_River">Battle of the Solstice</a>. The soldiers manage to cross the Piave River. But, although they had mobilized more men than at Caporetto, after only five days they were forced to <b>retreat and return behind the original lines</b>. Not only the Italian army effectively used their weapons and bombarded the enemies, as they had come to know the exact time of the attack, but also it rained heavily. The Piave River had risen so high that the Austrian soldiers were stuck in the middle. Those who had crossed it could not go back to the trenches, and at the same time they could not receive any supplies, both of food or equipment, from the camp. As we hear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Zo6-3g7qQ"><em>La leggenda del Piave</em></a>, one of the most famous folk song, written by the young soldier E.A.Mario after this battle, <b>«Il Piave mormorò: "Non passa lo straniero" [...] "No!" disse il Piave, "No!" dissero i fanti, "Mai più il nemico faccia un passo avanti!"»</b> (The Piave whispered: "The foreigner shall not pass” [...] "No!" said the Piave, "No!"said the infantrymen, "Never again will the enemy make a single step forward"). The victory of this battle <b>rencouraged the Italian army</b> after the Caporetto defeat, and the soldiers were starting to get ready to fight again, for the very last time.</p>

        <p align="justify">Armando Diaz and his lieutenant, Pietro Badoglio, were <b>afraid to act</b>. Even if the Austro-Hungarian Empire was beginning to collapse, as many of its smaller ethnical groups had started to rebell against the central power, the Italian commanders were convinced that the war would have lasted at least another full year. Both the King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_III_of_Italy">Vittorio Emanuele III</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Emanuele_Orlando">Prime Minister Orlando</a>, tried on several occasions to convince the Chief of Staff to attack the enemies. Orlando went to Padova, where the headquarters were located, to try to convince Diaz to act. But it would be months before the Italian army actually fought. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Austria">Kaiser Karl I</a>'s Empire was collapsing. Many of the soldiers belonging to the soon-to-be-formed States had fled the army, to return home and fight for their rights. A Czechoslovak division joined the Allies' front during the last battle, in order to fight and win over the Empire. </p> 
        <p align="justify"> On <b>October 24th</b>, 1918 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vittorio_Veneto">Battle of Vittorio Veneto</a> began. The Italian army took some time to cross the Piave River, but eventually, succeeded. The first three days were fought there and on Mount Grappa, and it was a <b>tough battle</b>. Not all the Austro-Hungarians were ready to surrender; some still wanted to protect their homeland at any cost. However, after a while, too many of them had either left the army or were taken prisoners by the Italians. Thus, little by little, day by day, the Italian soldiers managed to regain the lost territories. By October 30th, the battle was won and the Kaiser had sent some of his commanders to discuss the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Villa_Giusti ">armistice</a>. But Diaz was not ready to stop his army yet. <b>All the occupied territories had to be regained</b>. Negotiations between Austria-Hungary and Italy took place in Villa Giusti, in Padova. General Badoglio required both unconditional surrender and retreat to the borders of 1914. The pact was signed on the night of November 3rd. On the same day, Czechoslovakia proclaimed its independence, and a revolution broke out in Budapest. However, the cease-fire was set on the following day at 3.00 PM. The Italian army managed to liberate the whole of Veneto, along with the cities of Trento and Trieste, and the Istria peninsula, and it reached Innsbruck. <b>The war was won, and Italy was free again!</b> </p>

<div class="w3-padding-32">
    <p align="justify">Hi, I'm Giada! I am Digital and Public Humanities student at Ca’ Foscari University in Venice. My three great passions are travel, food, and history. I am <b >curious about the past</b> and love to discover anecdotes from people’s past lives. In fact, I always go to my grandmother’s house to listen to her stories. Recently we talked a lot about her parents, Ernesto and Iolanda. Therefore, when I was asked to do a Public History project, I convinced her to help me to commemorate my great-grandfather's <b>days as a soldier</b>. He was only eighteen years old when he was called to defend our Country, and he kept fighting until the end of the war. Ernesto never told actual stories about the battles, and only in his later years, after having been awarded the title of <em>Cavaliere di Vittorio Veneto</em>, did he begin to tell his relatives about being on the Isonzo Valley and on Mount Grappa. I have never met Ernesto but, suddenly, I felt the need to <b>come closer</b> to this honorable and reserved man. I wanted to understand <b>how a person could survive</b> after <b>experiencing such a traumatizing event</b> as World War I. So, I went to the <a href="https://www.museivittorioveneto.it/museo_della_battaglia/#"><em>Museo della Battaglia</em></a>, in Vittorio Veneto. </p> 
    <p align="justify">Former soldier <b>Luigi Marson</b> had collected many documents and finds from the battlefields and in 1938 decided to open this museum so that who fought in the war would <b>never be forgotten</b>. When the museum was renovated in 2012, it was decided to create an <b>immersive space</b> where each of the three floors had a theme: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Life in the Trenches</li>
        <li>Life during the Occupation</li>
        <li>From Battle to Myth</li>
    </ul>
     <p align="justify">Without any prior explanation, we are taken into a dark,narrow room. We are inside a trench. In real ones, soldiers spent all their days and nights. In this tunnel we can try to imagine the <b>sense of lonliness, helplessness, and discomfort</b> that they must have felt. Not only real objects, but also videos and sounds are here used to recreate the atmosphere and convey the message. <br>The main room on the second floor focuses on the miserable life of people who lived under the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Close to this space, there is the armory, where weapons unknown to me are kept, and folk songs are played. <br>On the third floor, the enemy is defeated. <b>The war is won!</b> This room is the most interesting. Everything is displayed as the founder of the museum, Luigi Marson, intended. At the time, in 1938, Italy had a fascist government that used the victory of the Great War as a justification to continue ruling the Country. It was decided to celebrate it as if it was a myth. As if the boys who had fought were great invincible heroes. <b>They are heroes, but they were not unbreakable</b>. Millions of teenagers died, and those who managed to survive were left with unthinkable burdens.<br></p> 
    <p>What this museum seeks to do, is to recontextualize the narrative of the First World War. It wants to remind us, that for three years those boys actually lived in trenches, they had to throw bombs, shoot a gun or defend themselves with a knife. For them, <b>that was reality, not a myth</b>. <br> After this project, I still have so many questions. But I now know that <b>I will never fully understand</b> how Ernesto felt and lived, and frankly I don’t even want to understand it. Because not understanding means that we are still leaving in a peaceful world, where senseless conflicts are <b>something that we only study, and not live</b>. </p>
